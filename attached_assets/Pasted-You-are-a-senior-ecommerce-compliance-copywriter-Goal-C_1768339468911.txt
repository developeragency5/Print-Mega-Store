You are a senior ecommerce compliance copywriter.

Goal:
Create 3 detailed, trust-building policy pages for my website Print Mega Store (www.printmegastore.net) that are consistent with each other and optimized to reduce Google Ads and Microsoft Ads “Misrepresentation / Unacceptable Business Practices” risk.

Business facts you MUST follow (do not invent anything):
- Store name: Print Mega Store
- Website: www.printmegastore.net
- Business model: Independent online retailer selling printers and scanners (primarily HP products)
- We are NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or authorized by HP or any manufacturer
- Platform: Lightspeed / Ecwid ecommerce system
- Market: United States customers
- Contact method: Email only → info@printmegastore.com
- Do NOT include any phone number or physical address
- We do NOT provide manufacturer warranty service, technical support, or repairs
- Warranty and technical support are provided by the manufacturer (e.g., HP)
- Payment methods must be secure electronic payments only
- We do NOT accept cash on delivery, checks, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency
- Prices are in USD and may be promotional or limited-time
- Avoid “Save XX%” language in policies; use “promotional price”
- Include “Last updated: January 2026” at the top of each page

Deliverables:
Create THREE separate policy pages. Each page must include:
- A short SEO Meta Title
- A short SEO Meta Description
- A Summary section at the top (3–6 bullet points)
- Clearly labeled sections with headings
- Professional, clear, customer-friendly language
- No HTML, no CSS, no technical markup — text content only

The three pages must use consistent wording, tone, and rules.
