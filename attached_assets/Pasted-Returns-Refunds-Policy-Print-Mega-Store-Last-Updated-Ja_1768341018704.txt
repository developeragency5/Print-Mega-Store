Thank you for shopping at Print Mega Store. We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase of printers, scanners, and accessories. Please read this Returns & Refunds Policy carefully before placing an order.

You may request a return and refund for most products within 30 days of delivery.
To be eligible for a return:
* The item must be unused
* The item must include original packaging
* All accessories, manuals, and included parts must be returned

To start a return:
1. Email us at info@printmegastore.com with your order number and reason for return.
2. We will respond with a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and instructions.
3. Pack the item securely and ship it back according to our instructions.
Do not send items back without an RMA number. Returns without an RMA may be refused.

3. Return Shipping Costs
* If the return is due to a defect or error on our part, we will provide a prepaid return shipping label.
* If the return is for any other reason (e.g., changed mind, ordered wrong model), the customer is responsible for return shipping costs.
* For international returns (if allowed), the customer is responsible for all return shipping charges.

4. Refunds
Once your return is received and inspected:
* Approved returns will be refunded to your original payment method.
* Refund processing may take 3–7 business days after we receive the returned item.
