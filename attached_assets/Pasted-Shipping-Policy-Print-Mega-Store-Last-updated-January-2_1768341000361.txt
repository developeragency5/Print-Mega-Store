Shipping Policy
Print Mega Store Last updated: January 2026
1. Order Processing
Orders are typically processed within 1–2 business days after your order is placed. Processing time refers to the time it takes to prepare your items for shipment — it does not include delivery time.
Orders placed on weekends or U.S. national holidays will be processed on the next business day.

2. Shipping Methods & Delivery Times
We offer the following standard shipping options for customers in the United States:
Shipping Method	Typical Delivery Time
Standard Shipping	5–7 business days
Expedited Shipping	2–4 business days
Priority/Express Shipping	1–2 business days
Delivery times are estimates and begin after your order is processed. Carriers can be delayed due to weather, carrier volume, or other factors beyond our control.
Tracking information will be sent to the email you provide during checkout once the shipment is created.

3. Shipping Costs
Shipping charges are calculated at checkout based on your selected method and delivery address.
You may see:
* A flat shipping rate
* Free standard shipping (if eligible, e.g., orders over a minimum amount)
Any promotional free shipping offers will be displayed clearly at checkout.

4. Order Tracking
Once your order has been shipped, you will receive a shipment confirmation email containing:
* Carrier name
* Tracking number
* A tracking link
If you do not receive tracking information within 48 hours of placing your order, please contact us at info@printmegastore.com.

5. Shipping Restrictions
Currently, Print Mega Store ships only within the United States (48 contiguous states, Alaska, and Hawaii).
We do not ship to:
* APO/FPO addresses (unless otherwise stated)
* U.S. territories not listed above
* International destinations
If you attempt to place an order outside our supported region, your order may be canceled and refunded.

6. Lost, Stolen, or Damaged Packages
If your package appears as delivered but you did not receive it, or if it arrives damaged:
1. Check with the carrier first to confirm delivery details.
2. If the carrier confirms loss or damage, contact us at info@printmegastore.com with your order number, and we will assist you.
Please keep images of packaging and items if damaged — this helps with claims.

7. Backorders & Out-of-Stock Items
If an item becomes out of stock after you place an order:
* We will notify you by email
* You may choose to wait for restock or cancel the item for a full refund
Items shown as “in stock” should match actual availability at the time of order.

8. Delivery Delays
Delivery estimates are not guaranteed. Carriers may experience delays due to:
* Weather events
* High volume periods (holidays, sales)
* Address issues
* Customs or other carriers’ factors
Print Mega Store is not responsible for delays caused by carriers.

9. Shipping Policy Changes
We may update this Shipping Policy at any time. Changes take effect when posted on this page, and the “Last updated” date will be changed accordingly.
